# SuSift! A Swift Calculator
After the COBOL and the Fortran versions (that are complete) and the Simula version, I created a Swift version!<br>
At the moment there are 8 functions, but I will add more of them in the future:)
The program compiles both in Visual Studio and on online compilers (for my non-Apple freinds)
