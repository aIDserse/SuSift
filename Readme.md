# SuSift! A Swift Calculator
After the COBOL and the Fortran versions (that are complete) and the Simula version, I created a Swift version!<br>
At the moment there are 8 functions, but I will add more of them in the future:)<br>
The program compiles both in Xcode and on online compilers (for my non-Apple freinds)<br>
You can take my code as Inspiration, and there are good example of basic and intermediate level syntax:)<br>
# License
The code is under WTFPL license. It's nearly like GPL, but better:))
