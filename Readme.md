# SuSift! A Swift Calculator
After the COBOL and the Fortran versions (that are complete) and the Simula version, I created a Swift version!<br>
At the moment there are 8 functions, but I will add more of them in the future:)<br>
The program compiles both in Xcode and on online compilers (for my non-Apple freinds)<br>
You can take my code as Inspiration, and there are good example of basic and intermediate level syntax:)<br>
# License
The code is under WTFPL license. It's nearly like GPL, but better:))
# Swift is expensive.
And it is natively executed only on Xcode<br>
Yes, there are versions for Windows and Linux, but they aren't very good...<br>
So, if you want to try out the program, here I leave it to you the final version on an online IDE<br>
So, if you want to see the indented code or you want to try it, go to the link down here:<br>
